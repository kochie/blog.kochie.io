If you grew up in the 2000s you probably remember the
[second browser war](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#Second_browser_war_(2004%E2%80%932017)>)
when Firefox, IE, and Chrome battled for browser dominancy. If you're one of the
70% of people who uses Chrome to surf the web than you know the outcome of that
competition. Chrome's dominance on the web has standardised a lot of web
technologies around Google services and ideas. This has come with a lot of
benefits, with the benefit of hindsight it's pretty clear that a lot of ideas
Google has had are great for the web, but I'd argue many more have been an
absolute disaster.

With the current rumors that the next Halo game will abandon the Slipspace
Engine in favour of Unreal Engine the same tradgedy that happened to the web may
just happen to the gaming industry.

Halo has been running on the same game engine since its inception and while it
has gone through some quite intense iterations the engine is still based on the
version that shipped with CE in 2001. That's a really impressive lifetime for a
piece of software that's run on 6 different pieces of hardware.
