This year I've been fortunate enough to work with a great team of passionate
engineers on the committee for the Young Engineers Australia (YEA) branch in
Victoria. We've been working hard to bring some great events to the community,
and I thought I'd share a few of them with you.

I was able to talk to
[Engineering Australia News](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/news-and-media/2022/11/meet-robert-koch-graduate-member-and-software-engineer)
about some of the lessons I've learnt so far in my engineering career. I wanted
to expand on some of the points I mentioned in the article.

I was recently elected as the Vice Chair of the Victorian division of the YEA-V
and I'm looking forward to working with the committee to bring some great events
to the community.
