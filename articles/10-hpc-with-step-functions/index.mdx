High Performance Computing (HPC) has become a mainstream method for the
processing in the fields of machine learning and data science. But the systems
that are used to create such high performance clusters are not always accessible
to everyday users. I found this out the hard way when I was working on a project
recently to (calculate the maximum number of objects that I could store inside
of S3)[]. It was easy enough to create a cluster of computers using EC2 batch,
but the processes is fairly involved if you're trying to run something fast and
cheap. I found a better way of solving the problem is using AWS Step Functions
and distributed maps to create a serverless HPC cluster capable of running lots
of small tasks at an incredible speed for a fraction of the price, and today I'm
going to show you how I did it.
