I recently realised that I was needlessly adding a huge amount of excess code to
my website by accidentally adding the entire fontawesome icon set using the
`library` object.

```tsx
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { fab } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { far } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons'
import { fal } from '@fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons'

library.add(fad, far, fas, fab)
```
