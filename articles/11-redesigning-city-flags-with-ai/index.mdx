Vexology is the study of flag designs, if you've ever listened to 99 Designs
you're probably very aware of what makes a good flag and what doesn't. There are
five rules for making a great flag, if you want more details I'd _highly_
recommend watching Roman Mars' excellent TED talk on the matter.

Good stuff eh? So to summarise the rules are:

1. Simplicity: A flag should be simple enough that a child can draw it from
   memory. Complex designs or intricate details may be difficult to reproduce
   and recognize from a distance or when the flag is flying.
2. Use of meaningful symbolism: The flag's design should represent meaningful
   elements, such as the history, culture, values, or geography of the place it
   represents. Using symbols that have a strong connection to the people and
   place will make the flag more significant and easier to remember.
3. two-three basic colors: Limit the number of colors used in the flag design to
   two or three. This ensures that the flag is easily recognizable and visually
   appealing. Stick to basic colors that contrast well, such as red, white,
   blue, green, yellow, and black.
4. No lettering or seals: Text, intricate seals, or logos should generally be
   avoided on flags, as they can be difficult to read or recognize from a
   distance, especially when the flag is in motion. Instead, use simple, bold
   shapes and symbols to convey the flag's meaning.
5. Distinctiveness: A flag should be unique and easily distinguishable from
   other flags. Strive to create a design that sets the flag apart from others,
   while still adhering to the principles of simplicity, meaningful symbolism,
   and limited color use.

Now that we know what a good flag should look like lets arrive at the point of
this post. Enter Melbourne, Australia.

![The City of Melbourne](melbourne.jpg?width=3840&height=2160)

The worlds move liveable city from 2012 to 2017, with such famous landmarks as
Flinders Street Station, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and the Arts
Centre. Host of the F1, the Australian Open, the AFL Grand Final. Home of great
coffee, and terrible flags...

![Flag of the City of Melbourne](Flag_of_Melbourne.png?width=2880&height=1440)

I know. I know. I know. Like what is going on in this flag? There's a bull, a
sheep, a whale, an anvil? All meant to symbolise industries that NO LONGER EXIST
IN MELBOURNE. Clearly we're in dire need of an update.

For a city that prides itself on art, sporting, and culture our flag doesn't
represent any of this. We need a new one, and since I'm not a graphic designer
(have you seen this website?) I decided to get an AI to build a new flag
instead.

Inspired by
[Jacobs's post](https://jacobmartins.com/posts/how-i-used-dalle2-to-generate-the-logo-for-octosql/)
about using Dalle-2 to generate app logos I'm going to use a very similar
methdology to generate a new flag for Melbourne.

There are two AIs that I shall be using in this experiment. Dalle-2, and
ChatGPT.

Dalle-2 is a state-of-the-art (as of 2022) AI for generating images from text.
For the technical reader it's what's known as a Gerneral Adversarial Network
(GAN) and uses a training database curated by an expert team at OpenAI to ensure
the highest quality images are used for generating results.

ChatGPT really needs no introduction at this point. When I originally started
writing this post last November OpenAI wasn't a household name like it is today.
In fact, it wasn't ChatGPT but rather GPT-3 that was making waves in the AI/ML
community. When I was thinking about how to describe GPT-3 I had a whole
paragraph about neural networks and autoregressive functions but there are many
more detailed explainations of the system to I'll link to those instead. The one
sentance explainer - ChatGPT/GPT-3|4 are a series of neural networks with a very
well catalogued training set that creates a chatbot with "human-like"
comprehension.

To begin with I started simple, I asked ChatGPT to make a flag for Melbourne.

And ChatGPT delivered...

Sure, I'd be happy to help you design a flag for Melbourne, Australia! When designing a flag, it's important to consider the history, culture, and symbolism of the city. Here's a suggested design for Melbourne's flag:

Design Elements:
1. Shape and size: The flag will be rectangular, with a 1:2 aspect ratio, similar to the Australian national flag.

2. Colors: The flag will feature four main colors - Blue, White, Green, and Gold. These colors represent the natural environment, the city's history, and Australia's national colors.

a. Blue: Symbolizing the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne and played a vital role in the city's development.
b. White: Representing the architecture and the heritage of the city, including iconic buildings like Flinders Street Station and the Royal Exhibition Building.
c. Green: Representing Melbourne's parks and gardens, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens and the numerous city parks that contribute to Melbourne's title as the "Garden City."
d. Gold: Reflecting the importance of the gold rush in Melbourne's history and its significance as Australia's sporting and cultural capital.

3. Layout: The flag will be divided into four equal horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being blue, followed by white, green, and gold at the bottom.

4. Symbol: In the center of the flag, over the white and green stripes, there will be a stylized representation of Melbourne's iconic Flinders Street Station's clock tower. The clock will be set at 6:00 PM, signifying the time when Melbourne was founded.

5. Stars: In the top left corner of the blue stripe, there will be a group of five white stars, representing the Southern Cross constellation. This is a nod to the Australian national flag and symbolizes Melbourne's location in the Southern Hemisphere.

By incorporating these elements, the flag will represent Melbourne's rich history, vibrant culture, and its connection to the Australian nation.
```

Pretty good! It understood a lot about what I'm trying to do. In my other
experimentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) I've noticed they're pretty
good at picking out the main ideas of what I'm trying to do but don't understand
some of the specifics. For example, the representation of the clock tower is not
something that would work well on a flag, especially having the hands point to a
specific time. In fact, I've never heard of this 6pm founding of the city
before, I think the AI has become confused somewhere. Anyway, time to make a
more specific declaration.

```[Wrap]
Can you refine your first flag design based on the above rules?
```

```[Wrap]
Of course! Based on the 5 Basic Principles of Flag Design, I can refine the Melbourne flag design as follows:

Design Elements:

    Shape and size: The flag will be rectangular, with a 1:2 aspect ratio, similar to the Australian national flag.

    Colors: The flag will feature three main colors - Blue, White, and Green. These colors represent the natural environment, the city's history, and Australia's national colors.

a. Blue: Symbolizing the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne and played a vital role in the city's development.
b. White: Representing the architecture and the heritage of the city, including iconic buildings like Flinders Street Station and the Royal Exhibition Building.
c. Green: Representing Melbourne's parks and gardens, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens and the numerous city parks that contribute to Melbourne's title as the "Garden City."

    Layout: The flag will be divided into three equal horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being blue, followed by white and green at the bottom.

    Symbol: In the center of the flag, over the white stripe, there will be a stylized white silhouette of a swan, symbolizing the native black swans that inhabit the region and the Swanston Street, a major city thoroughfare.

    Stars: In the top left corner of the blue stripe, there will be a group of five white stars, representing the Southern Cross constellation. This is a nod to the Australian national flag and symbolizes Melbourne's location in the Southern Hemisphere.

By simplifying the design, using only three colors, and focusing on meaningful symbolism, this refined flag design adheres more closely to the 5 Basic Principles of Flag Design, while still representing Melbourne's rich history, vibrant culture, and connection to the Australian nation.
```

```
There's a problem with the swans, this is a symbol of Perth, Western Australia, can you think of another symbol?
```

```[Wrap]
Apologies for the confusion. I understand the need to represent Melbourne uniquely. Instead of the swan, we can use a stylized depiction of a tram, which is an iconic mode of transport in Melbourne and a symbol of the city's modernity and progress. Here's the revised flag design:

Design Elements:

    Shape and size: The flag will be rectangular, with a 1:2 aspect ratio, similar to the Australian national flag.

    Colors: The flag will feature three main colors - Blue, White, and Green. These colors represent the natural environment, the city's history, and Australia's national colors.

a. Blue: Symbolizing the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne and played a vital role in the city's development.
b. White: Representing the architecture and the heritage of the city, including iconic buildings like Flinders Street Station and the Royal Exhibition Building.
c. Green: Representing Melbourne's parks and gardens, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens and the numerous city parks that contribute to Melbourne's title as the "Garden City."

    Layout: The flag will be divided into three equal horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being blue, followed by white and green at the bottom.

    Symbol: In the center of the flag, over the white stripe, there will be a stylized white silhouette of a tram, symbolizing the iconic mode of transport in Melbourne and representing the city's modernity and progress.

    Stars: In the top left corner of the blue stripe, there will be a group of five white stars, representing the Southern Cross constellation. This is a nod to the Australian national flag and symbolizes Melbourne's location in the Southern Hemisphere.

This revised flag design maintains simplicity, meaningful symbolism, and distinctiveness, while avoiding any confusion with Perth's symbols.
```

```
I don't think a tram is a good symbol, it's too generic, have another go.
```

```[Wrap]
I apologize if the tram symbol didn't meet your expectations. Let's try another symbol that is more unique to Melbourne – the Federation Square, an iconic public space and architectural landmark in the city. Here's the revised flag design:

Design Elements:

    Shape and size: The flag will be rectangular, with a 1:2 aspect ratio, similar to the Australian national flag.

    Colors: The flag will feature three main colors - Blue, White, and Green. These colors represent the natural environment, the city's history, and Australia's national colors.

a. Blue: Symbolizing the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne and played a vital role in the city's development.
b. White: Representing the architecture and the heritage of the city, including iconic buildings like Flinders Street Station and the Royal Exhibition Building.
c. Green: Representing Melbourne's parks and gardens, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens and the numerous city parks that contribute to Melbourne's title as the "Garden City."

    Layout: The flag will be divided into three equal horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being blue, followed by white and green at the bottom.

    Symbol: In the center of the flag, over the white stripe, there will be a stylized white silhouette of Federation Square's distinctive geometric shapes, symbolizing the iconic public space and architectural landmark in Melbourne.

    Stars: In the top left corner of the blue stripe, there will be a group of five white stars, representing the Southern Cross constellation. This is a nod to the Australian national flag and symbolizes Melbourne's location in the Southern Hemisphere.

By incorporating the unique and distinctive symbol of Federation Square, this revised flag design aims to represent Melbourne's cultural and architectural identity while adhering to the principles of simplicity, meaningful symbolism, and distinctiveness.

Okay third times the charm, I can work with this. Originally I planned to put
this prompt into Dalle-2, when I did I didn't get the results I was hoping for.

```[Wrap]
Create a flag for Melbourne, Australia with a 1:2 aspect ratio. Divide the flag into four equal horizontal stripes, with the top stripe being blue, followed by white, green, and gold at the bottom. On the blue stripe, place a group of five white stars in the top left corner, representing the Southern Cross constellation. In the center of the flag, over the white and green stripes.
```

![Dalle-2 results for creating a flag.](./Screenshot_1.png?width=2592&height=1106)

Definetly leaning on the Australian prompt a bit too much. I tried a few other
varations of the prompt and I didn't get great results. I've found that while
Dalle-2 is a great tool for creating abstract images it's not great at making
vector based art like flags and icons when you're looking for very specific
components.

I also gave Stable Diffusion a try as well and had very similar issues. I think
this is going to be one of the main herdles for AI/ML engineers to overcome in
the next few years.

So I went the manual path and made a flag using the results in Affinity
Designer.

![The redesigned Melbourne flag](redesigned_melbourne.png?width=2000&height=1000)

Like I said at the beginning, I'm not a graphic designer, but at least it
doesn't have a sheep on it.

So the funny thing is, I went searching for the flags of all the other
Australian capital cites, and they're all the same...

Not to be outdone by Melbourne Sydney's flag is arguably worse... much worse.

![Flag of Sydney](Flag_of_Sydney.png?width=2880&height=1437)

FOUR FLAGS IN ONE?! This flag is bonkers, Sydney, what are you doing! We can fix
this. This is the design that ChatGPT came up with.

```[Wrap]
Certainly, let's create a simplified flag design for Sydney, Australia that adheres to the principles of good flag design:

1. Shape and dimensions: The flag would maintain the width to length ratio of 1:2, consistent with the Australian national flag.

2. Background: The main background color would be a light shade of blue, representing the iconic Sydney Harbor and its beautiful beaches.

3. In the center of the flag: A white, stylized representation of the Sydney Opera House, with its distinctive sail-like roofs, would be placed in the center. The simplified design would retain the sense of the iconic structure while making it easier to recognize and reproduce.

4. Beneath the Opera House: A subtle wave pattern in a slightly darker shade of blue than the background would represent the Sydney Harbour Bridge's role in connecting the city and its people, as well as its position over the water.

5. Bordering the flag: A thin golden-yellow stripe would run along the top and bottom edges of the flag, representing the golden wattle, the Australian national floral emblem. This would provide a touch of color while symbolizing the natural beauty and diversity of Sydney's surrounding landscape.

This simplified design eliminates the Union Jack, adheres to the principles of good flag design, and focuses on a few key elements representing Sydney's unique identity.
