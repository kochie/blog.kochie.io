Vexology is the study of flag designs, if you've ever listened to 99 Designs
you're probably very aware of what makes a good flag and what doesn't. There are
X rules for making a great flag, if you want more details I'd _highly_ recommend
watching Roman Mars' excellent TED talk on the matter.

Good stuff eh? So to summarise the rules are:

1. rule
2. rule
3. rule

Now that we know what a good flag should look like lets arrive at the point of
this post. Enter Melbourne, Australia's flag

![Flag of the City of Melbourne]()

I know. I... I know. Like what is going on in this flag? There's a bull, a
sheep, a whale, an anvil?, All meant to symbolise industries that NO LONGER
EXIST IN MELBOURNE. So clearly we're going to need to update this.

For a city that prides itself on art and culture our flag is terrible. We need a
new one, and since I'm not a graphic designer (have you seen this website?) I
decided to get an AI to build a new flag.

Inspired by X's post about using Dalle-2 to generate app icons I'm going to use
a very similar methdology to generate a new flag for Melbourne.

There are two AIs that I shall be using in this experiment.

Dalle-2 is a state-of-the-art (as of 2022) AI for generating images from text.
For the technical reader it's what's known as a Gerneral Adversarial Network
(GAN) and uses a training database curated by an expert team at OpenAI to ensure
the highest quality images are used for generating results.

Stable Diffusion

So the funny thing is, I went searching for the flags of all the other
Australian capital cites, and they're all the same...

Sydneys looks like

Brisbane,

I can't event find Darwins?

What is Adelaide doing?

Parth.. okay i can work with this.
