The only way to offer In-App Purchases on the Apple Mac Store is to use Apple's
StoreKit API which provides a complete payment solution for MacOS apps. If
you're creating a native app this is fairly straight forward and well
documented, however if you're using a third party framework like Flutter or
Electron it can get tricky. Fortunately Electron provides first class support
for in-app purchases including
[a tutorial](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/in-app-purchases/)
for how to integrate your app with StoreKit, unfortunately the interface between
StoreKit and Electron doesn't provide a lot of feedback when things aren't
working properly. In this article I'm going to cover some of the challenges and
pain points I uncovered trying to get in-app purchases working in my app
[Touch Typer](https://touch-typer.kochie.io).

But first why am I trying to add in-app purchases? The answer comes from
**Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase** of
[Apple's App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase)
which states that apps must use Apple's payment service to handle any in-app
purchases. There are exceptions to this rule, back in 2021
[Epic took Apple to court](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown)
over their walled-garden monopoly and won a sort of compromise where apps can
link to other purchase methods, however Apple still takes a cut for facilitating
the purchase and will alert the user that the purchase method is not authorized
by Apple in a way that looks like a scam warning. So in order to provide the
best user experience Apple's in-app purchases are the best way to go.

These are the high level steps that we'll follow to get In-App Purchasing
working.

1. Create an In-App Purchase item in App Store Connect.
2. Create a draft release and include the in-app purchase as part of the
   release.
3. Implement the store logic in your app.
4. Build a development version of your Electron app for the Mac App Store.
5. Submit your app to the App Store.

## Creating Purchase Options in App Store Connect

After logging into App Store Connect and selecting your application there should
be a sidebar on the left, under **Monetization** there is an item for In-App
Purchases and Subscriptions. From here you can define different subscriptions
and purchases which can be made in your app, all purchases and subscriptions are
treated the same for our purposes so setting up one will behave exactly like the
other. Take note of the `PRODUCT ID` here as we'll need it later.

After you have created the purchase item you can setup a release. IAPs can only
be published to users via a new release, similar to how you would update your
app.

> recurring payments.

![Create a new app version and add the in-app purchase to the release](02_link_purchase_to_release.png?width=2000&height=1000)

In the new release you can select from the list of valid in-app purchases and
subscriptions.

Once the purchase option has been added to the release it will appear in the
submission, you can now create test builds of your app and once you're ready you
can submit the app for review.

## Setting up Electron

Electron apps have two separate processes, a `main` and `renderer`. The main
process runs in a node environment and can run privilaged code like writing to
the filesystem. The renderer runs inside of a browser environment and is
restricted in what it can access. Because of these restrictions it's not
possible to directly call the In-App Purchase APIs from a browser window so
we'll need to use electrons InterProcess Communication (IPC) library.

In you main electron file define the functions you want to expose to the
frontend environment. At the very least you probably want a `getProducts` and
`purchaseProduct` function.

```typescript lineNumbers filename="main.ts"
import { inAppPurchase } from 'electron/main'

app.on('ready', async () => {
  ipcMain.handle('getProducts', async () => {
    const products = await inAppPurchase.getProducts()
    console.log(products)
    return products
  })

  // This is a good way to test if the app is running in the Mac App Store
  ipcMain.handle('isMas', () => !!process.mas || process.env['ELECTRON_IS_MAS'])

  ipcMain.handle(
    'purchaseProduct',
    (event, productIdentifier: string, quantity: number) => {
      console.log(`Purchasing ${productIdentifier}...`)
      console.log(`Quantity: ${quantity}`)
      console.log(`Event: ${event}`)
      return inAppPurchase.purchaseProduct(productIdentifier, quantity)
    }
  )
})
```

These functions are now registered to run when a singal from the renderer
process is received in the main process.

We'll also need to register the functions in the frontend. The preload file runs
before the web page loads in the renderer, this is when we can perform prvilaged
operations like defining functions from the context bridge.

```typescript{16-19} lineNumbers filename="preload.ts"
declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface Global {
      ipcRenderer: IpcRenderer
      getProducts: () => Electron.Product[]
      purchaseProduct: (
        productIdentifier: string,
        quantity: number
      ) => Promise<boolean>
      isMas: () => boolean
    }
  }
}

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  getProducts: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('getProducts'),
  isMas: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('isMas'),
  purchaseProduct: (productIdentifier: string, quantity: number) =>
    ipcRenderer.invoke('purchaseProduct', productIdentifier, quantity),
})
```

Now with the IPC functions setup we can call them like normal functions from the
frontend.

![Now with the app setup you can retreive the product data and make purchases](04_products_listed.png?width=600)

This is an example of what the payload of `getProducts` looks like. It has all
the information you'd need to handle a purchase made in an app. You can now
create custom code to handle purchasing and subscriptions.

## Integrating with React

Something to consider when developing with React in Electron is that all IPC
functions are promises, this means that if you rely on an IPC function for
rendering you have to handle the asynchronous call. This isn't ideal considering
at the time of making this project the `suspense` feature was not stable.

My workaround for this is to create a new hook `useMas` which contains the
context for whether the app is running in a Mac App Store environment. There are
a few advantages to this design - hooks can be used everywhere, immediately to
render a page so there is no need to use `suspense`. The context of the
environment is also maintained throughout the app, no single view holds the
state of the MAS environment.

You can create a simple hook using a React context like the one here, in it the
state of the Mac App Store is eventually evaluated when the `isMas` function
returns. It will only do this when the context provider is intially mounted
which will happen when the app starts.

```typescript{12} lineNumbers filename="renderer.ts"
import { createContext, useContext, useLayoutEffect, useState } from "react";

type MasContextProps = boolean;

const MasContext = createContext<MasContextProps>(true);

export const MasProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [_isMas, setMas] = useState<boolean>(true);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // @ts-expect-error
    window.electronAPI.isMas().then(setMas);
  }, []);

  return <MasContext.Provider value={_isMas}>{children}</MasContext.Provider>;
};

export function useMas() {
  return useContext(MasContext);
}
```

What's useful about this hook is if you look on line 11 in `main.ts` you can
manually set `ELECTRON_IS_MAS` as an environment variable while developing to
test what the UI should look like in MAS mode, if you need to show a different
payment screen (you probably do) this is a great way to check it.

## Building a Dev App for the Sandbox Environment

This is all well and good but we can't actually test with the App Store until we
create a build of the app - signed by Apple. You can create dev builds that can
access your App Store sandbox account allowing you to make fake purchases
without spending money.

You will need to create a `macOS App Development` profile and a
`Mac Development` certificate in the Apple Developer portal before you can build
the app. If you're using `electron-builder` it should be as simple as running
the following command to create a new build.

```shell
electron-builder --config electron-builder.config.ts --mac mas-dev
```

Explaining how to setup Apple profiles and certificates is beyond the scope of
this article. If you're interested you can check out the
[docs](https://www.electron.build/code-signing-mac.html) for `electron-builder`
or have a look at some of the
[many](https://medium.com/ascentic-technology/getting-an-electron-app-ready-for-macos-distribution-2941fce27450)
[other](https://brunoscheufler.com/blog/2023-11-05-releasing-electron-apps-for-macos)
blogs about Electron provisioning, or better yet check out my project on GitHub
to see how I've setup the build environment.

<GithubProject repo="touch-type" owner="kochie" />

Once complete your app will have a binary that can be run locally, if you have
properly created a draft release in App Store Connect then this build will have
access to the products linked to the release and you'll see a success popup when
purchasing.

I hope this helps, I was stuck trying to figure out why I couldn't get In-App
Purchases working for a while. In my instance it turns out I hadn't created a
release which had the purchases linked. Please send me a tweet or a toot showing
your Electron project!
