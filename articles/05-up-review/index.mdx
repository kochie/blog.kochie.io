There's a chart I've been facinated with ever since I was shown it. It presents
the disruption that Uber created in the driving industry when it first entered
the New York City market. Having near exponential growth for the first few years
Uber quickly overtook the taxi industry in New York City. It's a stark reminder
to stagnant industries that disruption can come when you least expect it.

## Banks Used to Suck

The Australian banking industry before 2017 was in a similar situation. Due in
part to the
[Mining Boom](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-30/fact-check-mining-boom-and-the-global-financial-crisis/8849784)
Australia was one of the only countries in the west not suffer a recession
in 2008. With interest rates at a long term and _stable_ low there was very
little incentive for Australians to move banks or refinance their homes.

Additionally the lack of competition made the products provided by banks almost
identical. A savings account with almost no interest, a transaction account with
a monthly fee, credit cards that have huge fees and interest rates. This only
grew resentment, but most customers didn't have any better alternative - as can
be seen on the below chart until 2013 refinancing stayed quite low.

![Refinancing of Australian residential homes - [ABS](https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/refinancing-reached-all-time-high-july)](/abs_refinancing.svg?width=990&height=550)

But in the last few years as home prices increased and real wage growth
stagnated disapproval of the banks grew. This reached boiling point when the
government announced a
[Royal Commission](https://www.royalcommission.gov.au/banking) into banking
practices in Australia. A commission that resulted in minimal change to the
Australian banking system.

At around the same time a number of smaller "neobanks" started to begin
operating in Australia, these banks were met with mixed success but lot of
fan-fare as disgruntled customers were keen for a better deal.

Around the year 2015 the bulk of millennials started to reach the age where they
had significant savings and full time employment. With that this mobile first
generation started to look for a better way to manage their money.

Some readers might not know what a "neobank" is, if you're familiar with the
traditional system of banking you'd expect a bank to have physical branches
where you can go to deposit and withdraw your money. A neobank is different, for
starters they have no physical branches and operate entirely online, because of
this the types of services they provide are also quite different to a regular
bank. Generally only providing basic transaction and savings accounts.

But neobanks have offered another product to consumers - Trust.

I've noticed in my work that trust, and good intentions can make the difference
between a business succeeding or becoming a failure. Customers, especially
younger generations are more willing to switch to a new service if it aligns
with their morals and values more accurately[^3]. This means that companies can
no longer assume that their customers will stay with them just because they've
been around for a long time.

This isn't an entirely new phenomenon, different industries have had reckonings
when their customers have revolted, but banking is different. For one thing,
banking has been a very conservative industry, taking a long time to adapt new
technology and strategies. This is one of the reasons I believe that customers
are
[changing banks in record numbers](https://www.fool.com.au/2020/09/01/this-chart-shows-why-big-banks-are-in-trouble/).
Banks and other businesses now have to take into account their investments in
fossil fuels, tobacco, military technologies, and social movements when
considering
[market forces](https://www.marketforces.org.au/info/compare-bank-table/) that
will affect customer decision making.

This is also a deeper problem than what a PR blitz can fix, the underlying
issues go beyond branding as any reasonably good marketing company can help a
company look good.

## The Rise of Neobanks

Up is a great case study about the success a business can have when it focuses
on customer outcomes and not what the industry it's based in is doing.

![Up Logo](/UP-MEDIA-LOGO-LIGHT.svg?width=700&height=350&intrinsic=true)

When Up first came onto the scene in 2018 it already had a substantial following
of people who had used the product in its beta stage. Because of how different
and feature rich the product was the bank quickly became one of the largest in
Australia with over 400,000 customers[^1] at the time of writing.

### A Better Culture

In Australia the "big 4" major banks have roughly 73% of the Australian banking
market, that's down from 79% in 2013^[4]. It's not enough for companies to do
what their competitors are doing and simply catch up, doing so will only stop
the loss of customers and will not be able to bring old users back.

Up differentiated themselves early on as not being your parents bank. They
didn't have a home loan product, and they still don't offer credit cards. They
sold the idea of a responsible bank that would help you save money and support
initiatives that would help the environment.

Up expresses this difference on its social media, not using it for bland
updates, you'll find its handle on twitter
[@up_banking](https://twitter.com/up_banking) sending memes and gifs to
customers who are encouraged to share their "up stories" and anniversaries with
the team. In fact their entire team is quite active on social media including
their Co-Founder [Dom Pym](https://twitter.com/dompym), CEO
[Xavier Shay](https://twitter.com/xshay), and Content Lead
[Anne Shea](https://twitter.com/Annie_Shea) - something I don't think you'll see
a lot of banking executives doing. Exposing yourself on Twitter is a pretty
daunting thing to do, but it's a great way to show that you're a real person and
that you stand by your product.

I asked some Up customers what they like about the culture and platform compared
to their old banks and got a mix of different opinions. Matthew Timms put it
together quite nicely;

  <div>
    The Australian banking landscape, prior to the wave of neobanks, was an
    impersonal hellscape. Banks served businesses & home loaners; there was no
    rush to make the individual banking experience any better.
  </div>
  <div>
    Up, as a startup, needed to focus on user growth & they did so through
    developing an intuitive & enjoyable user experience which felt like a breath
    of fresh air. They scooped up millennials who felt neglected by big banks -
    they didn't own businesses nor mortgages. But they will in a decade.
  </div>
  <div>
    So as the wave of neobanks comes to an end, as we see many of them close
    their doors, Up stands by far the most successful Aus neobank & a
    fascinating story of industry disruption. Pfhfhf I could start a podcast
    about it but it wouldn't be very interesting.
  </div>

The story of Up's success if not a new one. There will be other companies that
disrupt industries and innovate ultimately delivering better outcomes for
consumers. The reason Up is so interesting is because it's a case study of how
customer loyalty can be earned when a company embraces their customers.

### Getting in my DMs

There are several examples of how Up's treatment of customers has differed,
sometimes wildly from what other banks are doing. Case-and-point very recently
the Osko instant payment system between banks
[went down](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-13/rba-osko-failure-delays-bank-transfers/101530182)
resulting in all transfers in Australia going back to the 3-day wait time. While
most banks only had a simple announcement stating there was a large scale event,
Up sent
[hourly updates](https://twitter.com/waxedham/status/1580390666479472641) to its
customers keeping them informed - some banks didn't event notify customers of
the outage!

This is done via their in-app communication panel which allows customer support
staff to talk to customers live without the need for a branch. Where traditional
banks require a customer to travel to a branch or pick up the phone to get
support all Up customers do is start a DM. Additionally the process is
asynchronous - so you can do other things while you're waiting for a response.
This is how disruption benefits consumers, while Up wasn't the first company to
add live chat in-app it was certainly the first bank in Australia to do so and
now most of them has some form of similar feature.

As you can see from the screenshots below the asynchronicity of getting support
is a big part of the experience, allowing customers to go through their day
instead of lining up at a branch.

![Up's in-app chat functionality for support](/join.png?width=5052&height=3178)

Earning trust with consumers is an incredibly hard endeavour, a piece of advice
one of my managers gave me not to long ago when dealing with this is to
"over-communicate" - that's exactly what Up does with its customers and is what
I see as the second reason that it's done such a good job at disrupting the hold
the "big 4" banks have on Australia.

### Features

The final reason is that Up is an objectively better product. When entering a
market segment as a new-comer there are only one way that you can take customers
from your competition - provide more value. You can generally do that in two
ways, either make a product that has more features at the same price, or to make
a product significantly cheaper. [Athena Home Loans](https://www.athena.com.au/)
is a great example of the latter, as a home loan provider there aren't many
features that customers really want besides the ability to own a home, so you
have to cut the price of your product which is exactly what Athena does.

Hugo was the person that introduced me to Up way back in 2017. He's a software
engineer and I asked what he was excited about when he first heard about Up.

    I was pretty amped for a bank building a new take on banking, and delivering
    quickly at the same time.
  </div>
  <div>
    Number one feature at the time was probably categorisation of transactions
    (groceries, life, home, transport, etc), and merchant identification.
  </div>
</Quote>

Up is particularly interesting because it's able to perform a juggle of both
these strategies. As a beta tester myself I remember being astonished at the
number of features the app came with compared to my previous bank, what was even
more bizarre was that the interest rate was _better_ than my old bank and had no
fees.

The added bonus of releasing new features means that people are more engaged
with the brand. Wanting to have the latest and greatest is a powerful incentive
to convince consumers to use your product. I asked a few people about what
features they care about in a banking app and a point that Emma Scully made sums
up nicely how Up has managed to attract a large group of followers.

  Up has re-framed my online banking into more of a organisational and
  productivity oriented experience rather than just an app where one can view
  their balance and transfer money. You don't typically hang out for a new
  update or follow the Instagram page of your usual banking apps, but Up brings
  exciting new features that actually gets you following your bank's social
  media to keep up.
</Quote>

Up also ties in its strategies of over-communication and new features together
with a public road-map - [Tree of Up](https://up.com.au/tree). Instilling a
sence of excitement and anticipation about a product keeps customers highly
engaged. This is the exact opposite of how most companies treat their feature
releases - secret and sporadic. Up flips that paradigm by showing what they're
working on and the timeline that they're expecting to release it. This approach
gives customers a feeling of trust that there will be future value on the
platform because they can see that more features and products are on the way.

![Tree of Up](/tree_of_up.svg?width=5059.85&height=3018.41)

There are a lot of lessons that can be learnt from Ups impressive rise to the
top, the most important for businesses is to listen to what your customers want
and build around that framework - stop looking at what your competitors are
doing just focus on building a great customer experience[^2].

### Final Thoughts

Don't stop innovating. Like in the case of Uber - when an industry stops
innovating it will eventually be disrupted. A new business model or company that
can shake up the market will do it. If Ups success indicates anything it's that
if the banking industry can be disrupted, any industry can be.
