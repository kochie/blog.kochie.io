What do I want to say?

The reason up is successful is because it build a product that people wanted,
listened to customers, kept them in the loop. When I've seen customers do that
it's worked out for them, and that's what we do as well as a CA.

One thing that I've noticed in my work is that reputation, trust, and good
intentions can make the difference between a business succeding or becoming a
failure.

will make customers happier and allow the buisiness to achieve it's goals.

This goes beyond branding as any reasonably good marketing company can help a
company appear to have these qualities.

Up is a great case study about the success a buisness can have when it focuses
on customer outcomes and not what the industry it's based in is doing.

When Up first came onto the scene in 2018 it already had a substancial following
of people who hd used the product in it's beta stage. Because of how different
and feature rich the product was the bank quickly became one of the largest in
Australia.

As a beta tester myself I remember being astonished at the number of features
the app came with compared to my previous bank.

In Austrlia the "big 4" major banks have roughly X% of the Australian banking
market, that's down from Y% in 2018. It's not enough for companies to do what
their competitors are doing and simply catch up, doing so will only stop the
loss of customers and will not be able to bring old users back.

Some readers might not know what a "neobank" is, if you're farmiliar with the
traditional system of banking you'd expect a bank to have physical branches
where you can go to deposit and withdraw your money. A neobank is different, for
starters they have no physical branches and operate entirely online, because of
this the types of services they provide are also quite different to a regular
bank. Generally only providing basic transaction and savings accounts.

    But yeah idk, the Aus banking landscape, prior to the wave of neobanks, was
    an impersonal hellscape. Banks served businesses & home loaners; there was
    no rush to make the individual banking experience any better.

  <div>
    Up, as a startup, needed to focus on user growth & they did so through
    developing an intuitive & enjoyable user experience which felt like a breath
    of fresh air. They scooped up millennials who felt neglected by big banks -
    they didn't own businesses nor mortgages. But they will in a decade.

  <div>
    So as the wave of neobanks comes to an end, as we see many of them close
    their doors, Up stands by far the most successful Aus neobank & a facinating
    story of industry disruption. Pfhfhf I could start a podcast about it but it
    wouldnt be very interesting.
