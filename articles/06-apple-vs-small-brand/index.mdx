blurb: How will small businesses compete when Apple shows up?

Another year, another WWDC.

This year at their World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) Apple announced a
number of expected updates across their product platform. New versions of MacOS,
IPadOS, and iOS were all unsurprising if not anticipated by Apple fans (some of
who will install the unstable build on their day-to-day devices). But what is
more interesting for me is the number of new services apple announced today that
will absolutely destroy some emerging markets and the companies in them.

Cast your mind back to the before times of the mid 2010s. I know, it's a long
time ago, but you'll remember how you might of used a credit card to cover a
large purchase like a sofa or computer. This all changed when a startup called
AfterPay launched in Australia back in 2014, since then Buy Now, Pay Later
(BNPL) has exploded in popularity around the world. The model is very simlar to
how the old department store lay-bys would work, where you as a customer would
ask the store to hold an item for you while you paid off the cost of the item,
usually in a few small payments over the course of several weeks. BNPL reinvents
this model by providing you with the funds straight away to purchase the item
while you pay back the vendor in installments. Now in the lay-by model stores
made their money in the marginal cost of the product and provided lay-by as a
service, sometimes they would charge a small fee to store the item for you. BNPL
vendors make their money off of late fees which they absolutely expect to occur,
they prey on people's laziness and desire to have products straight away.

What's more interesting is that in most authorities BNPL is unregulated because
the vendors are not providing a loan with interest (funny enough this is
actually how banks in mideval times got around the Catholic Churches ban on
interest). The ethics of BNPL is not the point of this article, but as a point
most countires are now in the process of regulating the sector, Austrlia leading
the charge [link to article]. Since the industry has expanded into a multi
trillion dollar sector larger companies (including banks) have set their sights
on producing their own BNPL solution. With the announcement of
[Apple Pay Later](), Apple is the first of the tech giants[^1] to put it's skin
in the game. Apple has the most money of any company in the world. With the
iPhone as a payment platform it's going to be incredibly easy for Apple to
aquire a market share in the BNPL sector.

I spoke with Economist Matthew Seymour about how Apple moving into the BNPL
sector will affect customers and vendors.

Apple is the latest to discover that it's profitable to lend people money. I'm
sure afterpay is quaking in its boots, but this was inevitable. The greatest
innovation that these BNPL schemes ever made was when someone in a backroom
somewhere thought "what if we just don't submit to regulation", and it is
unsurprising Apple has decided Apple Pay is the perfect entry onto this gravy
train.

This of course continues the trend of platform holders using their platform
advantages to displace the companies whose services made the platform attractive
in the first place. Although, as far as I'm concerned Afterpay can eat shit.

What I find interesting as well as the lack of customer loyalty that vendors are
facing.

  I guess Apple Pay's BNPL is more seamless and integrated vs how it is with
  currently Afterpay. But I guess also the concern with Apple joining the BNPL
  game is that might be seen as anti-competitive or problematic because now you
  owe money to Apple Bank.

But what are companies to do when Apple or some other company comes to eat their
lunch? I think the only option smaller companies have are to continue to
innovate and build features customers want. Large companies are generally lazy,
they don't enter a new segment unless it's a sure thing and they can guarantee
some sort of return.

  If you're a B2C startup that means you need to beat them with superior
  products and/or focus on a niche.

Hard to do it if you need to pivot during a down market competing with a $2T
company.

As a customer of

1Password, LastPass, BitWarden ==> Passkeys Mural, Micro ==> Apple Freeform Tap
to Pay ==> Square

- The pandemic has made companies dogfood their products at a much higher level.
- This has meant companies are now aware of how bad their products are in the
  market compared to what they thought.
- Many of the products in the market filled a niche, this niche eventually got
  large enough for companies like Apple to notice.
- Ultimately if companies want to succeed against Apple they need to focus on
  what their customers want.
- Because Apple provides a platform as a service it's in a unique position to
  completely dominate a market once it decides to compete.

[^1]:
    - Tech giants by my definition includes all the FAANG+ companies. Yes I
      guess PayPal can technically be considered a tech company but to me
      they're still a payment company.
