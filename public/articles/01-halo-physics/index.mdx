My all time favorite video game series is the halo franchise. The lore in the game spans over 100,000 years covering from the ancient past to the mid 2500s.

While the games have never been considered hard science they have always given consistent internal explainations for some of the more far fetched concepts seen in the game.

In the games lore the rings were created by an ancient race known as the Forerunners. While having anti-gravity technology 

Using only currently known methods there are two ways to create a force like gravity, mass and rotational intertia.

To calculate the required speed the ring needs to be spinning to create the same gravity felt at sea level on earth (which is $9.81ms^{-1}$) we first need to understand how large the rings are. Looking through the games the ring in Halo:CE is reported at $10,000km$ in diameter.
$$
diameter=10,000km = 1\times10^7m
$$

So starting with that the radius is half of the diameter.

$$
radius=5\times10^6m
$$

Circular motion equations are well known in physics, they're mostly taught in high school, for a refresher you can find them on wikipedia. Acceleration is given as:

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Subsituting in known values can yield an equation for velocity.

$$
9.81ms^{-2}=\frac{v^2}{5\times10^6m}
$$

Rearranging and evaluating outputs a result of $7000ms^{-1}$ or 7km a second! This seems pretty fast, and it is, for context at the equator the earth spins at $465.10ms^{-1}$. 

$$
v = \sqrt{9.81\cdot5\times10^6} \approx 7000 ms^{-1}
$$

So that answers the question of how fast the ring needs to spin to simulate Earth's gravity, but how long does it take for the ring to complete one rotation? Well the rate of rotation of an object is known as it's angular frequency and is defined by the amount of time it takes to complete one rotation. 
$$
\omega = 2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}
$$

So now we need to solve for omega using values we already know. There is another definition of angular frequency given by the velocity and radius of the rotation.
$$
\omega=\frac{v}{r}=\frac{7000ms^{-1}}{5\times10^6m} = 0.0014 rad s^{-1}
$$

Now that the angular frequency is known, it can be subsituted back into the formula, and the rotation time is calculated to be 1.25 hours!
$$
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{2\pi}{0.0014} = 4489 s = 1.25 hrs
$$

So to summarise, a ring with a diameter of 10,000km (which is 70% the size of the Earth) needs to complete one rotation in less than 90 minutes to simulate Earth's gravity. That's a pretty short amount of time, but is it so short that you would feel the negative effects from the spinning and become nauseous? 

Another intersting fact about rotational forces, the acceleration is proportional to the square of the velocity. That means that spinning at half the speed creates only a quater of the force. You can see this in the interactive tool I've added below. The diagram on the left shows the relative speed the ring needs to rotate to generate an acceleration equivalent to gravity (the red arrow), and the chart on the right shows how the acceleration changes based on the velocity.
