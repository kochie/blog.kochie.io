My all time favorite video game series is the halo franchise. The lore in the game spans over 100,000 years 

While the games have never been considered hard science they have always given consistent internal explainations for some of the more far fetched concepts seen in the game.

In the games lore the rings were created by an ancient race known as the Forerunners.

$$
diameter=10,000km = 1\times10^7m
$$
$$
radius=5\times10^6m
$$
$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

$$
9.81ms^{-2}=\frac{v^2}{5\times10^6m}
$$
$$
v = \sqrt{9.81\cdot5\times10^6} = 7000 ms^{-1}
$$

$$
\omega = 2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}=0.0014 rad s^{-1}
$$
$$
v=\omega\cdot r
$$
$$
\omega=\frac{v}{r}
$$

$$
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{2\pi}{0.0014} = 4489 s = 1.25 hrs
$$
