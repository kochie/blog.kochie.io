  I've logged a lot of miles this year and I've observed the insanity that is
  modern air travel. Here's a few highlights of my travels from the past few
  months.

As part of my day job I have the privilage of travelling around Australia to
support and empower our customers. Normally most of my clients are in Melbourne,
or prefer that I work remote, but there are still some instances where I need to
travel. Now I'm actually not a nervous flyer, or an anxious traveller, so a lot
of the situations I find myself in are due to my own lack of planning, so this
is my warning that if you get third party anxiety from reading about other
people's travel mishaps, you might want to skip this post.
