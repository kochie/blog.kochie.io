  But yeah idk, the Aus banking landscape, prior to the wave of neobanks, was an
  impersonal hellscape. Banks served businesses & home loaners; there was no
  rush to make the individual banking experience any better. Up, as a startup,
  needed to focus on user growth & they did so through developing an intuitive &
  enjoyable user experience which felt like a breath of fresh air. They scooped
  up millennials who felt neglected by big banks - they didn't own businesses
  nor mortgages. But they will in a decade. So as the wave of neobanks comes to
  an end, as we see many of them close their doors, Up stands by far the most
  successful Aus neobank & a facinating story of industry disruption. Pfhfhf I
  could start a podcast about it but it wouldnt be very interesting
