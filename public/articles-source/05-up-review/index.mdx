      But yeah idk, the Aus banking landscape, prior to the wave of neobanks,
      was an impersonal hellscape. Banks served businesses & home loaners; there
      was no rush to make the individual banking experience any better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up, as a startup, needed to focus on user growth & they did so through
      developing an intuitive & enjoyable user experience which felt like a
      breath of fresh air. They scooped up millennials who felt neglected by big
      banks - they didn't own businesses nor mortgages. But they will in a
      decade.

      So as the wave of neobanks comes to an end, as we see many of them close
      their doors, Up stands by far the most successful Aus neobank & a
      facinating story of industry disruption. Pfhfhf I could start a podcast
      about it but it wouldnt be very interesting.
